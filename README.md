# Point-and-Triangle

This C++ program is designed to work with points and triangles in a simple object-oriented manner. It includes classes for Points and Triangles and various functions to manipulate and analyze them.

The program first takes user input for coordinates of points and calculates the point closest to the origin.

It then allows users to input another point to test various functions, such as distance calculation and movement.

The program also works with Triangle objects, allowing users to create triangles, move them, calculate their perimeter and square, and check for equality.
